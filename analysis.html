            <p class="info-p">First Past the Post (FPTP) voting, commonly known as the Plurality vote, is the most common voting system. It is used everywhere in the world, in all sorts of situations. In the United States, people are pushing for FPTP (the Popular Vote) to replace the Electoral College.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="info-p">This method is the best for any situation involving only two candidates. The winning candidate is generally the one nearest to the biggest cluster of voters, as shown below, regardless of its proximity to all of the voters overall.</p>
